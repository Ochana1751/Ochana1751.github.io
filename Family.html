<h2><strong><font color="red">Mark Ochana</strong></h2>
<p>Mark plays a variety of games and is good at most games he plays or enjoys to play.
    He also goes to the gym I'd say about every other 2 days on average, whether to play basketball
    or lift. He is a very active and social person in my opinion, and is currently in college.</p> <br> <br>
<h2><strong><font color="Blue">Mona Ochana</strong></h2>
<p>Mona just didn't really do much back in the day. She was just chilling with the family, usually on her phone
    or doing something with another family member. I say her favorite hobby is relaxing because she
    usually just does nothing, whether on her phone or with another family member.</p> <br> <br>
<h2><strong><font color="Green">Yvette Ishak</strong></h2>
<p>Yvette is always supporting everyone in the family. She works tirelessly every day, providing food and
    cleaning around the house all the time. I say her hobby is relaxing because she barely ever gets to.</p> <br> <br>
<h2><strong><font color="Orange">Dankha Ochana</strong></h2>
<p>Dan is the man of the house. He works as an Engineer and supports aid and money to the family. I say
    his hobby is sleeping because he always takes super long naps on the couch whenever he gets the chance.</p>
